          %p.light.intro.more_text Playing tennis at the professional level since my teenage years allowed me to bring discipline, integrity and perseverance to any goal I am determined to succeed in. Competing in junior's and men's tournaments around the world for more than 8 years, playing 500+ official matches, 50+ cities in 13 countries, and 100000+ hours on practicing, I could not ask for a more plentiful childhood than this. With the highest ranking of #367 in World Junior Tennis, I begin my journey in men's professional tennis at the age of 18.
